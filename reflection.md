# Reflection on Building the jCarley Cosmetics Website

Building the **jCarley Cosmetics** website was a deeply insightful experience that highlighted how **AI-driven tools** can transform the development process. Throughout the project, I relied on **Cursor IDE**, **ChatGPT**, and **Supabase**, eventually deploying the finished product to **Vercel**. This combination of tools allowed me to work faster, experiment more confidently, and push beyond my current technical skill level. However, it also revealed some limitations of AI-assisted workflows and taught me valuable lessons about prompting, reviewing, and iterating.

From the start, **AI played a central role** in shaping both the technical and creative aspects of the project. Using **Cursor IDE**, I was able to integrate AI into my coding environment seamlessly. This meant that instead of manually writing every piece of code from scratch, I could describe features in natural language and let the AI scaffold out components or generate boilerplate code. This dramatically sped up the process, especially during setup tasks like configuring Next.js pages, setting up Supabase authentication, and connecting environment variables. For example, when I needed to integrate an image hosting service, ChatGPT quickly guided me on how to configure `next.config.js` to allow external image domains, saving hours of research.

One of the most powerful benefits was how **AI reduced mental overhead**. Normally, juggling front-end styling, back-end logic, and deployment configuration can be overwhelming. With AI as a coding partner, I could focus more on the overall design and user experience. When I ran into roadblocks—like debugging authentication errors or structuring Supabase tables—ChatGPT provided suggestions and explanations that helped me move forward without getting stuck.

However, there were **limitations and challenges**. AI-generated code wasn’t always perfect. Sometimes it produced solutions that didn’t fit my exact use case, leading to bugs that required careful troubleshooting. I also learned that vague prompts often resulted in incomplete or overly generic answers. For example, asking “set up authentication” was too broad, while asking “set up email and password authentication with Supabase in a Next.js app and redirect users after login” produced much better results. This taught me the importance of **precise prompting** and providing context, almost like writing a detailed specification for a collaborator.

Reviewing AI-generated code became a crucial step. At times, Cursor IDE would generate code that looked correct but introduced subtle security or performance issues. I had to carefully read through the code, test it thoroughly, and refine it with follow-up prompts. This iterative loop of **generate → review → refine** became a natural rhythm of the build process. Over time, I noticed that my own ability to predict AI outputs and guide them improved, showing how prompting itself is a skill that develops with practice.

Deploying to Vercel was surprisingly smooth thanks to AI guidance. The step-by-step instructions provided by ChatGPT helped me avoid common pitfalls like missing environment variables or misconfigured API keys. It felt empowering to deploy a working, full-stack app knowing that AI had helped me every step of the way.

Overall, this project changed how I view software development. AI didn’t just make me faster—it expanded what I thought I was capable of building. While there were moments of frustration, the experience reinforced the idea that **human creativity combined with AI assistance** can unlock incredible possibilities. Moving forward, I plan to refine my prompting skills, explore more advanced AI integrations, and continue using these tools to build impactful project.
